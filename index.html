        <h2>What's happening here?</h2>
        <p>You've probably experienced this conversation:</p>
        
        <div class="chat-example">
            <p><strong>Them:</strong> Hey, can I ask you a question?</p>
            <p><strong>You:</strong> 🙄 You just did. What's up?</p>
            <p><strong>Them:</strong> Do you know how to fix the printer?</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why This Is Inefficient</h2>
        <p>When you "ask to ask," you're:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding an unnecessary step to the conversation</li>
            <li>Making the other person wait for your actual question</li>
            <li>Creating anxiety ("what could they want?")</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="protip">
            <h3>👉 Just ask your question!</h3>
            <p>Instead of "Can I ask you something about JavaScript?", try:</p>
            <div class="good-example-container">
                <p class="good-example">"Hey! How do I fix this JavaScript error I'm getting?"</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Benefits of Direct Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The right person can respond (if in a group chat)</li>
            <li>Someone can prepare a thoughtful answer immediately</li>
            <li>You get help faster!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>More "Ask to Ask" Scenarios</h2>
        <div class="chat-example">
            <p><strong>Inefficient:</strong> "Hey, are you good with Excel?"</p>
            <p><strong>Better:</strong> "Hey, I'm trying to create a VLOOKUP formula that references another sheet. Could you help me with the syntax?"</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="chat-example">
            <p><strong>Inefficient:</strong> "Can I ask you something about the meeting?"</p>
            <p><strong>Better:</strong> "Do we need to prepare slides for tomorrow's client meeting?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chat-example">
            <p><strong>Inefficient:</strong> "Can I ask you a question about the project?"</p>
            <p><strong>Better:</strong> "What are the next steps for the project timeline?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chat-example">
            <p><strong>Inefficient:</strong> "Can I ask you about the new feature?"</p>
            <p><strong>Better:</strong> "How do I implement the new authentication feature in our app?"</p>
        </div>
            
        <h2>Common Concerns</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>"But I don't want to bother someone with a long question they can't answer"</summary>
            <p>Asking directly actually saves time for both parties! The person can quickly determine if they can help or direct you to someone who can.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>"Isn't it more polite to ask permission first?"</summary>
            <p>In most work contexts, being clear and direct is more respectful of everyone's time than excessive politeness that delays communication.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>"What if I'm interrupting them?"</summary>
            <p>If they're busy, they can respond when they have time. By providing the full question, you give them the information to decide how urgent it is.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>"What if I don't know who to ask?"</summary>
            <p>In that case, you can ask "Who can help me with X?" instead of "Can I ask a question?" This way, you get directed to the right person without the unnecessary step.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>"What if I need to ask multiple questions?"</summary>
            <p>Feel free to ask them all at once! Just make sure each question is clear and concise.</p>
